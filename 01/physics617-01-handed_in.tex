\section{Sodium in hcp und bcc}
\label{homework:1}

We have a transition from bcc to hcp with a fixed density. This density is the
number of atoms per volume. The volume is best taken to be the unit cell. The
bcc-lattice is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bcc}. There are eight atoms on the
corners of the cell. Only one octant contributes, so in total that is one atom.
The atom in the middle also contributes, therefore there are two atoms in the
bcc unit cell.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{bcc}
    \caption{%
        bcc-unit cell. Atom “suspended” by dashed lines is in the center of the
        cube. Not all atoms shown actually belong to the unit cell.
    }
    \label{fig:bcc}
\end{figure}

The density therefore is:
\[
    \rho = \frac{2}{V}
    \quad\text{with}\quad
    V = a^3 \,.
\]

The unit cell of the hcp-lattice is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcp-unit}. There
are two atoms per unit cell as well. The Bravais vectors of this system are the
following:
\[
    \tilde{\vec a}_1 =
    \tilde a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\ 0 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
    \tilde{\vec a}_2 =
    \tilde a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1/2 \\ \sqrt{3}/2 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
    \tilde{\vec a}_3 =
    \tilde a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\ 0 \\ \sqrt{8/3}
    \end{pmatrix}
\]

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{hcp-unit}
    \caption{%
        Unit cell of hcp-lattice. The three Bravais vectors are shown as well
        as the atoms belonging to the unit cell. The atom “suspended” by the
        dashed lines actually sits above the middle of the triangle
        ($\bigtriangleup$) suggested by the dotted line. It seems hard to find
        a decent projection for those lattices.
    }
    \label{fig:hcp-unit}
\end{figure}

The volume of this cell is
\[
    \tilde V = \tilde{\vec a}_1 \cdot [\tilde{\vec a}_2 \times \tilde{\vec
    a}_3] = \sqrt 2 \, \tilde a^3 \,.
\]
Therefore the density here is
\[
    \tilde \rho
    = \frac{2}{\sqrt 2 \, \tilde a^3}
    = \frac{\sqrt 2}{\tilde a^3} \,.
\]

The problem asks for constant density. The new lattice spacing $\tilde a$ is
desired. So we have
\[
    \rho = \tilde \rho
    \iff
    \frac{2}{a^3} = \frac{\sqrt 2}{\tilde a^3}
    \iff
    \frac{a^3}{2} = \frac{\tilde a^3}{\sqrt 2}
    \iff
    \tilde a
    =
    \sqrt[6] 2 \, a
    \,.
\]

After the transition, the new lattice spacing is a factor $\sqrt[6] 2$ larger
than before.

\section{Reciprocal lattice and Brillouin zone of the kagomé lattice}
\label{homework:2}

\subsection{Reciprocal lattice}

First we need to know the Bravais lattice. The two basis vectors are
\[
    \vec a_1 =
    a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \eqnsep
    \vec a_2 =
    a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \cos(\piup/3) \\
        1 \sin(\piup/3)
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1/2 \\ \sqrt{3}/2
    \end{pmatrix} \,.
\]
Both vectors have a length of $a$ which seems consistent. The unit cell is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kagome-unit}, it contains three atoms.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{kagome-unit}
    \caption{%
        Unit cell of the kagomé lattice. Only black points are really included,
        gray points are only for illustration of the tiling.
    }
    \label{fig:kagome-unit}
\end{figure}

The reciprocal basis can be found in a convenient way when those vectors are
generalized to $\R^3$ and a third basis vector $\vec a_3 := a\ev_3$ is added.
Then we have
\[
    \vec b_i = 2\piup \frac{\epsilon_{ijk} \vec a_j \times \vec a_k}{V} \,.
\]
The volume~$V$ is
\[
    V = \vec a_1 \cdot [\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3]
    = \frac{\sqrt 3}{2} \, a^3 \,.
\]
Now we can compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. They are
\[
    \vec b_1 = \frac{4 \piup}{\sqrt 3 \, a^3}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        a^2 \sqrt 3/2 \\ -1/2 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \frac{2\piup}{a}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\ - 1 / \sqrt 3 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \eqnsep
    \vec b_2 = \frac{4 \piup}{\sqrt 3 \, a^3}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\ a^2 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \frac{2\piup}{a}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\ 2 / \sqrt 3 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix} \,.
\]
Those reciprocal vectors are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:reciprocal}. They
span a triangular Bravais lattice, just as with the kagomé lattice. The length
of both reciprocal vectors is $2/\sqrt 3$ which also seems consistent.

\subsection{First Brillouin zone}

The first Brillouin is constructed from the reciprocal lattice.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{subfigure}[c]{0.5\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{reciprocal}
        \caption{%
            Reciprocal lattice vectors $\vec b_i$
        }
        \label{fig:reciprocal}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[c]{0.5\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{triagonal}
        \caption{%
            Triangular lattice spanned by reciprocal lattice vectors
        }
        \label{fig:triagonal}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{%
        Construction of the reciprocal lattice
    }
    \label{fig:brillouin-zone}
\end{figure}

To construct the first Brillouin zone, one selects one point in the reciprocal
lattice, this is the center of Figure~\ref{fig:brillouin}. Then one connects
the nearest neighbors (six in this case) with the center point. Those are shown
as dotted lines. Through each dotted line one constructs the perpendicular
bisector. In this case it actually goes right through the neighboring lattice
points due to the symmetry of the lattice. The area which is enclosed by the
bisectors (the hexagon) then is the first Brillouin zone.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{brillouin}
    \caption{%
        Construction of the first Brillouin zone. The emerging hexagon is that
        zone.
    }
    \label{fig:brillouin}
\end{figure}

The height of the hexagon is the reciprocal lattice spacing~$b$. This distance
is
\[
    b = \frac{4 \piup}{\sqrt 3\, a} \,.
\]
Together with the angles one can construct the hexagon edge length~$z$ to be
\[
    \frac{b}{2z} = \cos\del{\frac\piup6}
    \iff
    z = \frac{b}{\sqrt 3}
    = \frac{4 \piup}{3a} \,.
\]
The edge length~$z$ also is the distance of the center to one of the corners of
the hexagon.

\subsection{Possible wave-vectors}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{subfigure}[c]{.3\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{first-zone}
        \caption{%
            First Brillouin zone. The edge length of the hexagon is $z$.
        }
        \label{fig:first-zone}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[c]{.7\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{replicated-zone}
        \caption{%
            Replicated zone to show periodic boundary conditions.
        }
        \label{fig:replicated-zone}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{%
        First Brillouin zone.
    }
\end{figure}

The possible wave vectors~$\vec k$ are the ones lying in the Brillouin zone as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:first-zone}. All wave vectors lying strictly within
the zone are unique. Vectors lying on exactly on the boundary might be
redundant. Half of the edges are part of the first Brillouin

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{.5\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{unique}
        \caption{%
            Set of vectors in the first Brillouin zone. The shaded section belongs
            to the set as well as the vectors ending on the dashed line. The filled
            circle is included. The open circle is excluded since it is equivalent
            to the filled circle. The vector $\vec k$ is drawn as one sample vector
            to show that they all start in the origin.
        }
        \label{fig:unique}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{.5\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{discrete}
        \caption{%
            Allowed vectors in a $4 \times 4$ lattice.
        }
        \label{fig:discrete}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{%
        Vectors in the first Brillouin zone
    }
\end{figure}

$c = - 1/2$ and $c = 1/2$ both give an equivalent wave vector~$\vec k$ due to
the periodic boundary conditions of the Brillouin zone. Therefore one of them
has to be excluded to make the set consist of unique elements only.

This assumes that the solid extends periodically to infinity and therefore
arbitrary small wave vectors are sensible. When the solid only consists of
$N_i$~sites in each direction, the set of allowed wave vectors becomes
discrete.

\subsection{16-site lattice}

A 16-site lattice probably consists of $4 \times 4$ lattice points. This means
that the wave vectors are quantized in the direction of the reciprocal lattice.
Only four discrete wave vectors (including zero) are allowed. Still all linear
combinations in the zone are allowed. The resulting vectors are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:discrete}.

\section{Sodium in hcp und bcc}
\label{homework:1}

We have a transition from bcc to hcp with a fixed density. This density is the
number of atoms per volume. The volume is best taken to be the unit cell. The
bcc-lattice is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bcc}. There are eight atoms on the
corners of the cell. Only one octant contributes, so in total that is one atom.
The atom in the middle also contributes, therefore there are two atoms in the
bcc unit cell.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{bcc}
    \caption{%
        bcc-unit cell. Atom “suspended” by dashed lines is in the center of the
        cube. Not all atoms shown actually belong to the unit cell.
    }
    \label{fig:bcc}
\end{figure}

The density therefore is:
\[
    \rho = \frac{2}{V}
    \quad\text{with}\quad
    V = a^3 \,.
\]

The unit cell of the hcp-lattice is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcp-unit}. There
are two atoms per unit cell as well. The Bravais vectors of this system are the
following:
\[
    \tilde{\vec a}_1 =
    \tilde a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\ 0 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
    \tilde{\vec a}_2 =
    \tilde a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1/2 \\ \sqrt{3}/2 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
    \tilde{\vec a}_3 =
    \tilde a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\ 0 \\ \sqrt{8/3}
    \end{pmatrix}
\]

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{hcp-unit}
    \caption{%
        Unit cell of hcp-lattice. The three Bravais vectors are shown as well
        as the atoms belonging to the unit cell. The atom “suspended” by the
        dashed lines actually sits above the middle of the triangle
        ($\bigtriangleup$) suggested by the dotted line. It seems hard to find
        a decent projection for those lattices.
    }
    \label{fig:hcp-unit}
\end{figure}

The volume of this cell is
\[
    \tilde V = \tilde{\vec a}_1 \cdot [\tilde{\vec a}_2 \times \tilde{\vec
    a}_3] = \sqrt 2 \, \tilde a^3 \,.
\]
Therefore the density here is
\[
    \tilde \rho
    = \frac{2}{\sqrt 2 \, \tilde a^3}
    = \frac{\sqrt 2}{\tilde a^3} \,.
\]

The problem asks for constant density. The new lattice spacing $\tilde a$ is
desired. So we have
\[
    \rho = \tilde \rho
    \iff
    \frac{2}{a^3} = \frac{\sqrt 2}{\tilde a^3}
    \iff
    \frac{a^3}{2} = \frac{\tilde a^3}{\sqrt 2}
    \iff
    \tilde a
    =
    \sqrt[6] 2 \, a
    \,.
\]

After the transition, the new lattice spacing is a factor $\sqrt[6] 2$ larger
than before.

\section{Reciprocal lattice and Brillouin zone of the kagomé lattice}
\label{homework:2}

\subsection{Reciprocal lattice}

First we need to know the Bravais lattice. The two basis vectors are
\[
    \vec a_1 =
    a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \eqnsep
    \vec a_2 =
    a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \cos(\piup/3) \\
        1 \sin(\piup/3)
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    a
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1/2 \\ \sqrt{3}/2
    \end{pmatrix} \,.
\]
Both vectors have a length of $a$ which seems consistent. The unit cell is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kagome-unit}, it contains three atoms.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{kagome-unit}
    \caption{%
        Unit cell of the kagomé lattice. Only black points are really included,
        gray points are only for illustration of the tiling.
    }
    \label{fig:kagome-unit}
\end{figure}

The reciprocal basis can be found in a convenient way when those vectors are
generalized to $\R^3$ and a third basis vector $\vec a_3 := a\ev_3$ is added.
Then we have
\[
    \vec b_i = 2\piup \frac{\epsilon_{ijk} \vec a_j \times \vec a_k}{V} \,.
\]
The volume~$V$ is
\[
    V = \vec a_1 \cdot [\vec a_2 \times \vec a_3]
    = \frac{\sqrt 3}{2} \, a^3 \,.
\]
Now we can compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. They are
\[
    \vec b_1 = \frac{4 \piup}{\sqrt 3 \, a^3}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        a^2 \sqrt 3/2 \\ -1/2 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \frac{2\piup}{a}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\ - 1 / \sqrt 3 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \eqnsep
    \vec b_2 = \frac{4 \piup}{\sqrt 3 \, a^3}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\ a^2 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \frac{2\piup}{a}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\ 2 / \sqrt 3 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix} \,.
\]
Those reciprocal vectors are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:reciprocal}.

\subsection{First Brillouin zone}

The first Brillouin zone is spanned by those reciprocal vectors. The zone is
centered symmetrically around the origin. It is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:brillouin}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{reciprocal}
        \caption{%
            Reciprocal lattice vectors $\vec b_i$
        }
        \label{fig:reciprocal}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{brillouin}
        \caption{%
            First Brillouin zone with marked corners
        }
        \label{fig:brillouin}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{%
        Construction of the first Brillouin zone
    }
    \label{fig:brillouin-zone}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Possible wave-vectors}

\newcommand{\setK}{\text{\bfseries\sffamily K}}

The possible wave vectors~$\vec k$ are the ones lying in the Brillouin zone as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:brillouin}. This set is spanned by the reciprocal
lattice vectors and can be parametrized like this:
\[
    \setK = \Set{c^i \vec b_i \colon c_i \in \left(- \frac12 , \frac12 \right]}
    \,.
\]
$c = - 1/2$ and $c = 1/2$ both give an equivalent wave vector~$\vec k$ due to
the periodic boundary conditions of the Brillouin zone. Therefore one of them
has to be excluded to make the set consist of unique elements only.

This assumes that the solid extends periodically to infinity and therefore
arbitrary small wave vectors are sensible. When the solid only consists of
$N_i$~sites in each direction, the set of allowed wave vectors becomes
discrete.
